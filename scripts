Let’s examine the syntax in greater detail.

First, you specify the name of the table that you want to create after the CREATE TABLE  keywords. The table name must be unique within a database. 
The IF NOT EXISTS is optional. It allows you to check if the table that you create already exists in the database. If this is the case,
MySQL will ignore the whole statement and will not create any new table...


Second, you specify a list of columns of the table in the column_list section, columns are separated by commas.


Third, you can optionally specify the storage engine for the table in the ENGINE clause. You can use any storage engine such as InnoDB and MyISAM. 
If you don’t explicitly declare a storage engine, MySQL will use InnoDB by default.


InnoDB became the default storage engine since MySQL version 5.5. The InnoDB storage engine brings many benefits of a relational database management system such as ACID transaction, 
referential integrity, and crash recovery. In the previous versions, MySQL used MyISAM as the default storage engine...
